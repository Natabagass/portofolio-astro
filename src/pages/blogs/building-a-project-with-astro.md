<p class="text-title">
  Astro is a modern framework designed specifically for building fast and lightweight websites. Unlike many other JavaScript frameworks, Astro employs a unique approach to rendering content. Itâ€™s known for its "Islands Architecture," where static content is rendered on the server, and interactive components are added client-side only when needed. This makes Astro particularly efficient for content-heavy websites such as blogs, documentation sites, or portfolios.

<h2 class="font-bold text-xl">CHARACTERISTICS OF ASTRO</h2>

---
<br />
<p class="text-title">Astro has several key characteristics that set it apart from other frameworks:</p>

<ul class="list text-title"> 
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Server-Side Rendering (SSR) by Default</span>: Astro renders pages on the server, sending static HTML to the client, and only adding JavaScript when necessary. This enhances page performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Zero JS by Default</span>: Astro only sends HTML to the browser by default, minimizing the amount of JavaScript loaded for the user.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Island Architecture Support</span>: With Astro's "Island Architecture," JavaScript is only sent where it's needed, such as for interactive components, rather than the entire page.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Component Based</span>: Astro uses a component-based approach, allowing developers to combine components from different frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte in the same project.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Static Site Generator (SSG)</span>: Astro is a static site generator, meaning it compiles all the content at build time, resulting in fast, static pages that require minimal server-side processing.
  </li>
</ul>

<br />
<h2 class="font-bold text-xl">ADVANTAGES OF ASTRO</h2>

---

<ul class="list text-title"> 
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Performance Optimized</span>: Since Astro ships minimal JavaScript by default, it improves load times and overall performance, particularly on mobile devices or slower connections.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Flexible Framework Support</span>: Astro supports components from various frameworks, allowing you to mix and match technologies like React, Vue, or Svelte within the same project.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">SEO Friendly</span>: Static site generation in Astro makes it ideal for SEO as the content is rendered as plain HTML, making it easy for search engines to crawl.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Low Learning Curve</span>: If you are familiar with JavaScript and modern front-end libraries, you will find Astro easy to pick up and use.
  </li>
</ul>
