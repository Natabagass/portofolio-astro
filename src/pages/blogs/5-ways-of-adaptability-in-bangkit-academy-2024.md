    As is started being a student in Bangkit Acadmey 2024, I understand that every journey I take to learning there is definitely an obstacle that must be faced. Then I saw how important adaptability is in every path taken. So here are the 5 ways of adaptability that I got from Bangkit 2024 program.

<h2 class="font-bold text-xl">WAYS OF INTERACTING</h2>
<br/>

<p>
    When Bangkit programs started and it was held all online, interacting with new friends from different universities, different backgrounds, age, experience and all stuff it’s kind of a little challenging for me. Then you need to talk in english when doing a Mandatory session like ILT when you want to answer and ask, that was make me nervous at the first time when i was trying to do it. But, because of that I was leveling up my self-confidence to talk in English and learning how to speak English more clearly.

<h2 class="font-bold text-xl">WAYS OF ACHIEVING</h2>
<br/>

<p>
    Bangkit had a timeline program that showed to all students in the beginning of programs when it started. Then I need to plan it for 1 week, how many courses or how many sub modules I can achieve in 1 week. Then there is a capstone timeline that was held for 1 month, so I need to build a team with my friend and make our purpose the same way to achieve the capstone.

<h2 class="font-bold text-xl">WAYS OF LEARNING</h2>
<br/>

<p>
    In Bangkit programs, I was learning it by doing hands-on practice, reading more about the course and exploring more outside of the course to make a clear understanding about the material that I learn in the course. In Bangkit there is a deadline too for you to learn the course, so i need to learn it and understand it quickly. Sometimes i was asking or discuss with my friend or my mentor when i got a problems that i can’t solve it.

<h2 class="font-bold text-xl">WAYS OF WORKING</h2>
<br/>

<p>
    There are so many activities in the Bangkit timeline that you need to complete it according to the deadline. Then I made myself more disciplined about the task that was already given to complete it before the deadline so all the tasks can be done in the right time.

<h2 class="font-bold text-xl">WAYS OF THINGKING</h2>
<br/>

<p>
    I built a new mindset when I was joining Bangkit programs. I did not realize that I had a fixed mindset before I was joining the Growth Mindset in the ILT Soft Skill session. Then, after that I changed my mindset to be more understanding about myself so that I can be more than I am right now . I don’t need to watch others' achievements and be more grateful about what I have achieved and done.
