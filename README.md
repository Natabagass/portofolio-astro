Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my **very first portfolio** website! 🎉  
This project is something I started because I was *gabut* (bored) and wanted to experiment with Astro. 🚀 I’ve heard great things about it and thought, why not give it a shot? So, here it is—my humble portfolio made with **Astro** and **Tailwind CSS**! 🎨

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**: I used Astro as the main framework for this project. It's fast, easy to use, and perfect for static websites like this portfolio.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: For styling, I chose Tailwind CSS because it's super flexible and helps me build clean, responsive designs easily.
- **HTML5**: Just the good ol' HTML for structure. 🏗️
